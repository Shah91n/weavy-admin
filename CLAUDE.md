## Rules (non-negotiable)

### Structure
- `core/` has zero Qt imports — pure business logic and CLI wrappers only. All Weaviate / `gcloud` / `kubectl` / `aws` calls live here.
- Each feature lives entirely inside its `features/<name>/` package.
- **Strict three-layer split** (non-negotiable, applies to every feature):
  - **UI lives in a view file** (`view.py` or `<name>_view.py`). Qt widgets, layouts, signal wiring, QSS object names. Never makes blocking network/CLI calls.
  - **Background work lives in a worker file** (`worker.py` or `<name>_worker.py`). One `QThread` subclass per logical operation. The worker is the *only* place a view-driven `core/` call is invoked.
  - **Data / business logic lives in `core/`**. Pure Python, returns plain dicts/lists. No Qt, no threading, no UI concerns.
  - View imports worker. Worker imports `core/`. `core/` imports nothing from `features/`. No layer skips.
- `features/` files must not import each other — use `shared/` or `core/` for cross-cutting concerns.
- Dialogs live in `dialogs/` — never inside a feature or sidebar file.

### AppState
- Views subscribe to `AppState` signals directly — no weakref lists, no manual push loops in `main_window`.
- `AppState` is the single source of truth for connection config and namespace.

### Router
- Adding a new feature = one line in `app/router.py`. Nothing else in `main_window` changes.
- Tab deduplication check always happens in the router before constructing a view.

### Workers
- Every worker lives in its own file (`worker.py` or `<name>_worker.py`) — never inline inside a view.
- Every worker inherits `shared/base_worker.py` — already has `error`, `progress`, and `cancel()`.
- A worker that needs a typed `finished` payload defines its own `finished = pyqtSignal(<type>)` (PyQt6 can't override signal payloads via inheritance).
- Store workers as `self._worker` — never as a local variable.
- First line of every `finished`/`error` handler: `self._detach_worker()`.
- Never call `QThread.wait()` on the UI thread.
- Check `self._alive` before touching Qt widgets in async callbacks.
- New signal on any worker → add it to `_DETACH_SIGNALS` in `shared/worker_mixin.py`.

### Styling
- All colour hex values in `shared/styles/global_qss.py` (global) or `shared/styles/infra_qss.py` (infra) — never hardcode hex in QSS strings or feature code.
- `GLOBAL_STYLESHEET` set once on `QApplication` in `main.py`. Views inherit — never repeat.
- `INFRA_STYLESHEET` applied once to the root widget of infra views.
- No `setStyleSheet()` on individual child widgets — use `setObjectName()` + QSS selectors.
- Dynamic states (success/warning/error) → switch `setObjectName()`, not inline styles.
- Text content the user might want to copy (summary stats, IDs, error messages) → use `Qt.TextInteractionFlag.TextSelectableByMouse` on the `QLabel`.

### UI consistency
- Sibling views inside the same feature share their layout primitives — summary panels, headers, banners, empty-state labels — via a **feature-local** base class in the same view file (e.g. `ClusterOperationViewSpecialBase` in `features/cluster/operation_special.py`). This applies to **UI helpers only** — it does not override the view/worker split: workers always live in their own file.
- Don't promote UI helpers to `shared/` until at least two features genuinely need them.
- Deviate from the shared primitives only when the underlying data shape genuinely demands it (e.g. a view with no summary, or one that needs a fundamentally different table). When deviating, leave a one-line comment explaining why.
- When polishing one view in a sibling group, propagate the change to the others in the same commit.

### Buttons
- **Default = green, app-wide.** Every `QPushButton` inherits the global green style from `_QSS_BUTTONS` in `shared/styles/global_qss.py` — including infra views. Do not introduce a new "secondary"/grey style; there is no `secondaryButton` selector and there is no separate infra button identity.
- **Custom `setObjectName()` only for genuinely different visual treatment.** Allowed: `*DangerBtn` / `dangerButton` (red destructive — Delete, Revoke, Cancel-of-running-op), `disconnectButton` (red), `backupCancelBtn` (red, cancel running backup), `deleteCollectionsDeleteButton` (red), `diagFixReplicationButton` (yellow warning), `refreshIconBtn` (transparent icon-only chrome), `schemaHeaderBtn` (sidebar icon chrome), `stsCollapseBtn` (infra collapse-toggle chrome), `aboutCloseButton` / `aboutCheckUpdateButton` (subtle About-dialog chrome), `backupFilterBtn` (toggle/chip), `queryAgentSuggestionButton` (large suggestion card), `createCollectionAddPropBtn` (dashed-outline add). Anything outside these intentional roles → drop the objectName and let it inherit green.
- **No decorative emojis/icons next to a text label.** `QPushButton("Edit")`, not `QPushButton("✏  Edit")`. `QPushButton("Refresh")`, not `QPushButton("⟳  Refresh")`. The text is the label; an icon next to it duplicates meaning and breaks visual consistency.
- **Icon-only buttons are fine** — when the icon *is* the label and there is no text (e.g. toolbar `↻`, `×`, `⊠`, `⚙`, `🗑`), keep the icon. Pair these with `refreshIconBtn` / `schemaHeaderBtn` / equivalent icon chrome.
- **Functional indicators inside the label stay.** Collapse-toggle arrows (`▼ Summary`, `▶ Enabled Modules`) signal expand/collapse state. Directional words inside the action (`Set Selected → READY`) carry meaning the words alone don't. Keep both — they are not decoration.

### Naming
- Every feature uses the same name across: file, class, sidebar label, tab ID, tab label, QSS object name, signal names. Rename all atomically.

### Weaviate specifics
These are client/server behaviours that are not visible from the code and have already caused bugs:

- **Named vectors hide the top level.** `collection.config.get().to_dict()` **pops** `vectorIndexType`
  and `vectorIndexConfig` from the top level whenever `vectorConfig` is present — which is every
  modern collection, including the single unnamed `default` vector. Anything reading vector index
  settings must go through `vectorConfig[<name>]` and fall back to the top level only for legacy
  collections. `core/weaviate/schema/diagnostics.py:iter_vector_indexes()` is the canonical helper —
  reuse it rather than re-deriving the traversal.
- **Vector index settings are per-vector and per-type.** Four index types exist: `hnsw`, `flat`,
  `dynamic`, `hfresh`. Each has a different mutable subset and a different `Reconfigure.VectorIndex.*`
  builder. Never assume HNSW. The mutable tables in `core/weaviate/collections/update.py`
  (`_MUTABLE_INDEX_FIELDS`, `_MUTABLE_QUANTIZER_FIELDS`) mirror the immutability rules enforced by
  Weaviate core in `adapters/repos/db/vector/<type>/config_update.go` — when adding a field, verify
  against core, not just the docs, and add it to the table rather than to a call site.
- **Compression is per vector index, not per collection.** One collection can have a compressed and
  an uncompressed named vector. HFresh always has RQ (mandatory, cannot be disabled); Flat has no
  user-facing compression decision. **Compression is create-time only** — the update UI retunes an
  already-active quantizer and never offers enable / disable / switch. Verified against a live
  cluster: switching quantizers is refused outright ("you must recreate the collection"), and a new
  HNSW index already has RQ enabled by default on 1.38, so a genuinely uncompressed index is rare.
  Disabling one is technically accepted by the server but forces a full re-encode, so it is not
  exposed.
- **A dynamic index is two indexes.** Core validates its `hnsw` and `flat` halves with those types'
  own validators, so build each half with its own builder — see `DYNAMIC_SUB_INDEXES`.
- **The server always emits every quantizer block** (`pq`/`bq`/`sq`/`rq`, no `omitempty`), even when
  disabled. The Python client's `to_dict()` emits only the active one — do not confuse the two
  shapes: the client's update path merges against the *server's* JSON, and would `KeyError` on a
  missing block.
- **Batch imports use `batch.stream()`** (server-side batching, Weaviate 1.36+) — the server paces
  the import via backpressure, so no batch size is tuned by hand. There is deliberately no
  `fixed_size()` fallback: this project targets current clusters only.
- **`failed_objects` lives on the batch wrapper**, i.e. `collection.batch.failed_objects` after the
  context exits — *not* on the object the context manager yields. Reading it off the yielded batch
  silently returns nothing and every failure disappears. For MT, read it off the same
  `with_tenant()` handle the batch was opened on.
- **Send only what the user changed.** Reconfigure objects treat `None` as "leave alone", so the
  update view submits only fields whose widget value differs from the loaded config. Re-sending an
  untouched quantizer transmits a sub-config the user never edited — and on HFresh that alone
  triggers a client-side `KeyError: 'pq'`.
- **Weaviate reports enum *values*, the UI keys on member *names*.** The schema says `"acorn"` /
  `"TimeBasedResolution"`; the enum members are `ACORN` / `TIME_BASED_RESOLUTION`. Match on both,
  case-insensitively, or dropdowns never preselect the current value.

### Code Quality
- Type hints on all functions including `__init__` and signal handlers.
- No unused imports, no dead code — remove on every task.
- `Callable` from `collections.abc`, never lowercase `callable` as a type.
- Run before finishing any task:
  ```bash
  ruff check --fix . && ruff format . && ruff check .
  ```
  Zero errors required.

### Before Finishing Any Change
1. Update call sites after any method signature change.
2. Grep all usages after renaming/removing an attribute.
3. Check all workers for the same bug pattern after fixing one.
4. Update `CLAUDE-PLAN.md` if there is an active plan — mark completed steps, add notes.
5. Explicitly enumerate which CLAUDE.md rules apply to the change and state ✅ / ⚠️ for each. If anything is ⚠️ flag it instead of silently moving on.
