# WeavyAdmin

WeavyAdmin is an open-source desktop GUI for administering and managing Weaviate vector database clusters to manage collections and schemas, inspect nodes and shards, run keyword/vector/hybrid searches, handle RBAC, ingest CSV data, manage backups, run diagnostics, and operate the underlying Kubernetes infrastructure (GKE/EKS). WeavyAdmin brings the most common administration and operations tasks into a single desktop app.

## Installation (macOS DMG)

Download `WeavyAdmin-X.X.X.dmg` from the [Releases](https://github.com/Shah91n/WeavyAdmin/releases) page, open it, and drag **WeavyAdmin** to Applications.

**First launch:** macOS will block the app with a security warning because it is not notarized. To open it:

1. Click **Done** on the warning dialog
2. Go to **System Settings → Privacy & Security**
3. Scroll down to the Security section — you will see **"WeavyAdmin was blocked"**
4. Click **Open Anyway**

This is a one-time step per machine.

## Installation (Linux AppImage)

Download `WeavyAdmin-X.X.X-x86_64.AppImage` from the [Releases](https://github.com/Shah91n/WeavyAdmin/releases) page, make it executable, and run:

```bash
chmod +x WeavyAdmin-*.AppImage
./WeavyAdmin-*.AppImage
```

No Python, Qt, or system dependencies required — everything is bundled.

## Build AppImage from Source

Build your own AppImage on any Linux machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Shah91n/WeavyAdmin.git
cd WeavyAdmin
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
pip install appimage
python -m appimage.build
```

The AppImage is written to `dist/weavy-admin-x86_64.AppImage`.

## Run from Source

**Requirements:** Python 3.10+

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Shah91n/WeavyAdmin.git
cd WeavyAdmin
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
python main.py
```

**Optional tools** (only needed for Kubernetes / cloud infra features):

| Tool | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `gcloud` + `kubectl` | GCP GKE cluster access |
| `aws` + `kubectl` | AWS EKS cluster access |
| `go` | Flame graphs in pod/cluster profiling |

Install these via your system package manager (Homebrew on macOS) and ensure they are on your PATH.

## Features

- **Dashboard** — cluster health, quick-action grid, environment info, and enabled modules at a glance
- **Node Details** — verbose per-node info table
- **Shards Details** — all shards with search and filter
- **Shards Indexing Status** — view every shard replica, bulk set READONLY → READY, multi-select actions
- **Shard Rebalancer** — COPY/MOVE replica operations, compute and apply a balance plan, monitor replication operations (requires `REPLICA_MOVEMENT_ENABLED=true`)
- **Collection Management** — create (Custom Schema or CSV); bulk-delete via the sidebar `×` button with a multi-select picker, filter, and per-collection results
- **Update Collection Config** — edit the mutable settings of `invertedIndexConfig`, `replicationConfig`, `multiTenancyConfig`, and per-named-vector `vectorIndexConfig`. The vector index form is driven by the collection's actual `vectorIndexType` — **HNSW**, **HFresh**, **Flat**, or **Dynamic** — so only fields Weaviate accepts for that type are offered, along with the active quantizer's tuning fields. Only changed fields are submitted. Compression itself is a create-time decision and is never enabled, disabled or switched from here
- **Aggregation Report** — per-collection / per-tenant counts with CSV export and a single-collection (or single-tenant) on-demand counter
- **Schema Diagnostics** — cluster health checks, shard consistency, replication analysis, and per-named-vector compression analysis (reports the vector index type alongside each finding)
- **Search Data** — right-click any collection → choose BM25 keyword, Vector Similarity (near_text / near_vector), or Hybrid search; supports filters, metadata return, named vectors, and multi-tenancy
- **RBAC Manager** — create/edit/delete roles, manage DB users and OIDC groups, assign/revoke roles
- **RBAC Report & Logs** — aggregated insights and authorization audit log viewer
- **Query Agent** — natural-language chat using the Weaviate Query Agent (Weaviate Cloud only); supports **Ask** (generated answer), **Search** (retrieval only), and **Suggest** (propose example queries for the selected collections, with optional instructions and a configurable suggestion count)
- **CSV Ingestion** — drag-and-drop CSV import with MT and BYOV support. Uses Weaviate **server-side batching** (`batch.stream()`, Weaviate 1.36+) so the server paces the import; live log box reports progress and surfaces each failed object reported by Weaviate
- **Backups** — create, restore, cancel backups; usage statistics report
- **Log Explorer** — live-tail Kubernetes pod logs with structured columns and real-time search
- **LB Traffic** — HTTP Load Balancer / ALB traffic viewer for GCP and AWS
- **StatefulSet** — live Weaviate StatefulSet dashboard (replicas, resources, env vars, modules)
- **Pods** — pod list with status, restarts, and age; double-click to open a full Pod Detail tab
- **Pod Detail** — five-tab pod dashboard: Overview, Containers, Environment, Volumes, Events & Config
- **Pod Profiling** — Go pprof capture for a single pod with goroutine analysis and optional Claude AI review
- **Cluster Profiling** — batch pprof capture across all weaviate-* pods with per-pod progress
