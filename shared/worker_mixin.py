======================
WorkerMixin – shared worker lifecycle management for all view classes.

Single canonical copy. Never duplicate this file.
Import path for all views: ``from shared.worker_mixin import WorkerMixin``

Every view that owns a background QThread worker inherits this mixin to get:
- _detach_worker()  — safely disconnect all signals and orphan/deleteLater the worker
- cleanup()         — called by workspace.py before tab removal
